        The company was founded in September 2006 by University of Southern
        California roommates Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill.
        <div className={s.info}>
          - Beck and Merrill sought funding from family and angel investors,
          raising US$1.5 million to launch their company. Riot Games was
          established in September 2006 in Santa Monica, California. The first
          person Riot Games recruited was Steve "Guinsoo" Feak, one of the early
          developers of DotA Allstars, a game considered to have been
          foundational to the MOBA genre. As they refined League of Legends'
          initial creation, they pitched investors a video game company rooted
          in e-commerce. Merrill said that they approached publishers who were
          baffled by the game's lack of a single-player mode and free-to-play
          business model. After several rounds of funding totalling $8 million,
          including investments by the Benchmark and FirstMark Capital venture
          capital firms, as well as Chinese holding company Tencent, who would
          later become League of Legends' distributor in China, and then the
          parent company of Riot Games. - It was September 2006, and Riot Games
          had just opened up its offices in an old converted machine shop under
          an Interstate 405 overpass in Santa Monica. Jew said his interview
          ended up being a long chat about Warcraft, DOTA, and his playing
          habits. As soon as it wrapped up, the two offered Jew an $11-an-hour
          internship.

          - The group threw themselves into the development of a game they
          initially called Onslaught. They wrote a massive design document and
          focused on creating entirely new characters — the original DOTA used
          the intellectual property of Blizzard — while slapping together a
          demonstration of the game in about four months that could be shown at
          the 2007 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.

          - In 2009, Riot earned an estimated $1.29 million in revenue according
          to estimates by SuperData. The following year, that revenue was up to
          $17.25 million, according to SuperData. And in 2011, Riot Games
          revenue rocketed to more than $85 million. That same year Chinese
          gaming and internet giant Tencent Holdings purchased 97 percent of the
          company for $400 million.

        Six month of beta tests.
        <div className={s.info}>
          - Following six months of beta tests, Riot Games released League of
          Legends as a free-to-play game on October 27, 2009. Their game
          designers and executives participated in online forums to make
          adjustments based on player feedback. On May 10, 2010, Riot Games
          announced that they would take over distribution and operation of
          their game in Europe; to do so, Riot Games relocated their European
          headquarters in Brighton to new offices in Dublin. In February 2011,
          Tencent invested $400 million for a 93 percent stake in Riot Games.
          Tencent bought the remaining 7 percent on December 16, 2015; the price
          was not disclosed. - Just months into the game’s launch, Riot Games
          ran into a massive wall in Europe. The company had partnered with a
          local company to handle the game’s operation there, but players were
          increasingly unhappy with the game there. Merrill said it was because
          of their partner didn’t have the same values and simply weren’t
          invested in the level of support needed there. The result was that
          players in Europe struggled to log into the game and often ran into
          technical online issues -- sometimes lasting entire weekends. So Riot
          convinced the company to hand back control of the game to them in
          Europe. However that put them on a deadline that gave them 53 days to
          not just take over operations, but set up their own data centers. They
          made it, but just barely. Within three months of the May 2010
          hand-off, European growth -- which had been well behind North America
          -- was now 9 percent stronger and growing.

        New content for League of Legends.
        <div className={s.info}>
          - Is one of the largest esports in the world. - During 2010 and 2011,
          the Riot Games team developed new content for League of Legends; it
          was during this time that the company realized that people also liked
          to watch the game being played. As a result, Riot Games established
          its own League of Legends esports leagues which produce weekly
          broadcasts and create a professional game schedule. Following Riot
          Games' first world championship event in 2011, a small affair at a
          conference in Sweden, the company decided to turn their tournaments
          into professional sports-like events. It invested in broadcasting
          equipment, hired sports programming producers, and trained pro gamers
          to be "TV-ready". In 2012, Riot Games held its tournament at
          University of Southern California's Galen Center, offering $1 million
          in prize money. Riot Games has since held tournaments in Berlin,
          Seoul, Madison Square Garden in New York City, and the Staples Center
          in Los Angeles. - In 2009, Riot earned an estimated $1.29 million in

          one of the largest esports in the world, but in 2011 Riot had just
          started experimenting with the idea of pro play. The company hosted
          the first season championships at the annual DreamHack celebration in
          Sweden in June 2011, attracting more than 1.6 million viewers.

        By 2013, League of Legends was the most-played multiplayer PC game in
        the world.
        <div className={s.info}>
          - In 2012, in response to toxicity and harassment in League of
          Legends, Riot Games launched a "player behavior team" of psychologists
          to combat harassment on its platform. Riot Games' tactics to address
          issues on League of Legends, including an opt-in chat function between
          opposing players, informing banned players of the reasoning behind the
          ban, and creating a tribunal of players to weigh in on bans, resulted
          in a 30 percent drop in reported harassment behavior. The efficacy of
          their results has been questioned by players and the gaming press. By
          2013, League of Legends was the most-played multiplayer PC game in the
          world. From 2014 to 2016, the number of active League of Legends
          players grew from 67 million to more than 100 million.

        Relocated to a new building.
        <div className={s.info}>
          - Riot Games relocated to a new building on a 20-acre (8 hectare)
          campus in West Los Angeles in 2015. In March 2016, Riot Games acquired
          Radiant Entertainment, another developer who was working on Rising
          Thunder and Stonehearth at the time. Rising Thunder was effectively
          canceled following the acquisition, with the game's team allocated to
          a new project. On October 13, 2017, Beck and Merrill announced that
          they were returning their focus to developing games, aiming to create
          new experiences for video game and esports players. Beck and Merrill
          handed over the day-to-day operations and overall management of the
          League of Legends team to three longtime employees: Dylan Jadeja,
          Scott Gelb and Nicolo Laurent, who previously served as chief
          financial officer (CFO), chief technology officer (CTO) and president,
          respectively. Subsequently, Gelb and Laurent assumed roles as chief
          operating officer (COO) and chief executive officer (CEO),
          respectively, while Beck and Merrill became the Riot Games' chairmen.
          As of May 2018 , Riot Games employs 2,500 people, operating 24 offices
          around the world.

          - The company sells corporate sponsorships, merchandise, and streaming
          rights for its esports league. In 2015, investors bought stakes in
          teams and began building their own squads. Among the team owners in
          Riot Games' leagues are the owners of the Washington Wizards,
          Cleveland Cavaliers, Houston Rockets, Golden State Warriors,
          Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Dodgers, AOL co-founder Steve Case,
          and life coach Tony Robbins. Inc. cited the growth of the leagues and
          high-profile ownership as part of its reasoning for making Riot Games
          its 2016 Company of the Year. Following debates over whether pro
          players and coaches should have a greater share of Riot Games' esports
          revenue and concerns raised about the company making in-game changes
          prior to matches, the company issued an open letter in 2016 promising
          higher revenue shares and more collaboration with professional teams.
          In 2017, Riot Games held the League of Legends World Championship in
          China, with the finals taking place in Beijing. The same year, the
          company announced it would franchise its ten-team North American
          League of Legends Championship Series, which cost at least $10 million
          to enter.

          the company’s culture, reporting multiple incidents of sexism from a
          large number of sources at Riot Games. The story — which detailed
          unfair treatment of women employees at Riot — led to an internal
          investigation, lawsuits, a state fair employment investigation, a
          walkout, and an effort by the company to improve workplace treatment
          and culture that included hiring a new chief diversity officer.

        A 90-day plan starting.
        <div className={s.info}>
          - Riot has also been criticized by its employees for requiring the use
          of forced arbitration in its employment contracts as a result of the
          gender discrimination lawsuit. Riot allowed employees to speak
          anonymously with the press, and indicated their intent to use town
          hall meetings and smaller group discussions with Roseboro and
          employees to determine future action. Riot also committed to removing
          mandatory arbitration in new employee contracts and potentially for
          existing ones after the current litigation had been settled.
          Additionally, Riot established a 90-day plan starting in May 2019 to
          continue to address internal issues related to diversity and
          inclusion. Despite this, over one hundred Riot employees staged their
          walkout on May 6, 2019, demanding that Riot end forced arbitration for
          all past and current employees as well. About two weeks following the
          walkout, Riot reverted their position, saying that they will not
          change forced arbitration in existing agreements while the current
          litigation against the company is ongoing.
